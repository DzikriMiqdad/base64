# **Base64 Encode/Decode App**

This application allows users to encode and decode strings using the Base64 algorithm. This application can also be called a Cryptography application.<br>
_**Cryptography** is the process of hiding or coding information so that only the person a message was intended for can read it._



## **Features**
<p dir="auto"><strong>Text Input for Encoding: </strong>Users can input any text to be converted to Base64.<br>
<strong>Text Input for Decoding: </strong>Users can also input strings in Base64 format to be converted back to plain text format<br>
<strong>Encoding and Decoding Result Output: </strong>The results of the encoding and decoding process are displayed directly on the screen.<br>
<strong>Copy to Clipboard Function:</strong>Users can copy the encoding or decoding results easily using the dialog that appears.
<p>
Here is a storyboard that illustrates the workflow of this application:

## Conclusion

The Base64 Encoder/Decoder application that has been created aims to make it easier for users to convert plain text into Base64 format and vice versa. This application has a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing users to quickly perform encoding and decoding without any difficulty.
